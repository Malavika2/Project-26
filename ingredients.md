Ingredients Needed To Make Chocolate Mousse...

1. Heavy cream – this rich ingredient makes the mousse light and fluffy and amazingly decadent.

2. Egg yolks – this thickens up custard mixture in the mousse and boosts richness.

3. Granulated sugar – you can adjust this slightly to taste.

4. Vanilla extract – I usually like to add a fair amount of vanilla to chocolate desserts. It compliments those flavors so nicely.

5. Bittersweet chocolate – use chocolate baking bars or other good quality chocolate bars.

6. Sea salt (optional) – regular table salt works fine too. You only need to add a pinch or two, and honestly it can even be omitted. It just picks up the flavors a bit.
